<h5> Script for recording and reproducing actions </h5>
<p>The pet project is a script for one commercial project, designed to record actions, save the action log in the form of a json file, as well as the ability to further reproduce this log. It catches all activity, takes into account the initial state of the system when recording, and also takes into account switching between application windows.</p>
